**Context** (optional)

In order to improve the frames per second (fps) performance of our garbled circuit evaluation, we need to consider both the efficiency of the evaluation itself in terms of gates/ms and the total number of logical gates required for each frame, which is directly linked to the screen resolution. As a rough approximation, the number of pixels to display is proportional to the number of gates.

While it is not strictly necessary to hide the transaction message from a security standpoint, it is crucial to make it exceedingly difficult for an attacker to identify and modify this message in memory. Please refer to the [Interstellar Secure UX/UI](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/interstellar-secure-ux-7d7f095403c9) article for more details.

To address this concern, in the M5 milestone, we incorporated the transaction message within the circuit itself to prevent unauthorized modifications. However, including the message in the circuit significantly increased the number of gates that need to be evaluated, resulting in a performance of only 3 fps. In M3, our circuit consisted of 80,000 gates, while the updated circuit with the included message now contains 314,970 gates.

So, we have develloped a new garbling scheme, from scratch, drawing inspiration from the whitepapers [A New Framework for Garbled Circuits](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/article-3351.pdf) and [A New Approach to Garbled Circuits](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/739.pdf). This new scheme proven secure against PPT adversary, achieves a 10x performance improvement compared to the previous method i.e fancy garble, while still incorporating the transaction message within the circuit. Our optimizations, including parallelization and free gates, contribute to this significant boost in performance.

We believe that by implementing additional optimizations and reducing the size of the circuit, we can approach our target fps objective without sacrificing the desired high resolution. One approach to achieve this is to include only a portion (half or less) of the transaction message pixels in the circuit. This modification effectively prevents attackers from modifying the message, as modifying only a part of it would be futile. We will incorporate this change in the next milestone related to our circuit design modification/optimization.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we also propose an additional test where the resolution of the displayed message is reduced by half, approximating the circuit size in the upcoming milestone.
